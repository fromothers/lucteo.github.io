**Lucian Radu Teodorescu** is a Software Architect from [Cluj-Napoca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca), Romania. He holds a PhD in Computer Science, working on the creation of the [Sparrow programming language](https://github.com/Sparrow-lang/sparrow).

After work, if he is not involved in over-the-ocean Skype calls (work related), he is still working on the Sparrow programming language. Lucian is pretty fond of the Sparrow vision, and (foolishly?) thinks that with a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, Sparrow can be a widely used programming language.

Besides working and working, Lucian can be found arguing philosophy with his beautiful wife [Adriana](https://adrianateodorescu.wordpress.com/) (poet, researcher in Comparative Literature, Death Studies, Sociology). Empirically, these debates happen most of the time after midnight.

Lucian doesn't have a lot of friends; maybe because he doesn't like beer and clubs. He prefers quality over quantity.

After trying various ways of expressing how you would pronounce his name ([Lucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian), Luke, Lucy, [Luciano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Pavarotti), Lucienne, etc.), he finally found the _solution_ when had a hard time making the difference between how an English-speaking friend pronounced "_solution_" and "_so, Lucian_". Therefore the joke: "Lucian, part of the solution". See also [this](http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/lucian).

This blog is about staying true to oneself.
